Theme parks continuously seek to improve guest experiences by optimizing attraction scheduling and reducing wait times. Despite these efforts, existing systems such as Disney Parks' Online Fastpass/Genie+ often result in unequal experiences among visitors, with discrepancies largely based on socioeconomic status and prior knowledge of park operations. This gap allows seasoned visitors to disproportionately benefit from the parks' services, leaving less experienced guests at a disadvantage. This paper addresses the inefficiencies observed in Disney Parks' reservation and pass allocation strategies. I adapt the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to these systems with the purpose of allocating expedited queue passes more fairly, aiming to provide a more balanced experience for all visitors. By reforming how wait times are distributed, this study offers insights for enhancing product and operation strategies within the theme park industry.
